We recommend using **Static Generation** (with and without data) Duis vitae consequat magna, ac pellentesque lorem render the page, on every request.

You can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:

- Marketing pages
- Blog posts
- E-commerce product listings
- Help and documentation

You should ask yourself: "Can I pre-render this page **ahead** of a user's request?" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.

On the other hand, Static Generation is **not**  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed quis aliquam metus. Proin sit amet odio non sem faucibus dignissim.. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.

In that case, you can use **Server-Side Rendering**. Nam scelerisque eget erat non sollicitudin. Aliquam accumsan nisi, quis bibendum viverra. Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate data.
